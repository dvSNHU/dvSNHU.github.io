## CODE REVIEW

The importance  of a code review is to find issues in the current iteration of the code base and plan fixes and improvements. This ensures the quality of the code meets a minimum expectation held by the developers and company.

## Software design and engineering

The artifact I chose for the Software design and engineering category is the a block breaker game we created in CS330. This game used opengl to draw the bricks, platform, and balls that are displayed on runtime. The reason I chose this project for the artifact was to illustrate my ability to expand an existing project and add the needed functionality that would make this game with a single level into a full game that could potentially be released for public consumption. I added a menu, level selection screen, and multiple new levels. This enhancement also used reading and writing to a local file to store the progress of the player so the dont have to restart from level 1 every time via the level selection screen. I believe the most significant challenge I faced was the implementation of text for the menu and level selection screens. I eventually created methods that I felt were satisfactory in this situation although for a more reusable implementation I would have prefered to create a new class specifically for writing text to the screen.

## Algorithms and data structure

The artifact I chose for the Algorithms and data structure category is a simple paint calculator that was made in the IT-145 course. This project calculated the amount of paint that would be needed to pain a wall of dimensions determined by the user input. This simple program also implemented input validation to ensure that the user input was the correct type to directly use in calculations. I improved this program by creating dedicated input validation functions that were called from the main function. This reduces the repeated code and makes it easiier to maintain in the future. I also added the functionality to store and read the calculation history. The reason I chose this program for my second artifact was to showcase my ability to take an existing code base and bring it up to proper standards by factoring out repeated code into its own functions and determine proper data structure requirements to store and read the calculation history which was also stored on an external file while also minimizing the amount of data that needed to be stored externally.

## Databases

The artifact I chose for the Databases category is the event tracker that was made in CS-330. This program is an event tracker app that is made in android studio. It offers the ability to create an account, add events, edit events, and delete them as well. When this application was made it used a local database instance to store and read the information entered by the user when making an account and events. I chose this application for the 3rd artifact to show my ability to create and setup a database, backend API, and integrate them with a client side application. The API I created acted as the middleman that allowed the client to verify user credentials and retrieve their personal events. It also added a layer of security for the database from unapproved access. Lastly, the application was also rewritten, to an extent, to use this new API and use encryption of user passwords to ensure data is not transmitted between networks as plain text. The main challenge I faced when implementing this enhancement was learning how to make and recieve http requests to make the API calls and get the returned data to be used within the app.
