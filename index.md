## Software design and engineering

The artifact I chose for the Software design and engineering category is the a block breaker game we created in CS330. This game used opengl to draw the bricks, platform, and balls that are displayed on runtime. The reason I chose this project for the artifact was to illustrate my ability to expand an existing project and add the needed functionality that would make this game with a single level into a full game that could potentially be released for public consumption. I added a menu, level selection screen, and multiple new levels. This enhancement also used reading and writing to a local file to store the progress of the player so the dont have to restart from level 1 every time via the level selection screen. I believe the most significant challenge I faced was the implementation of text for the menu and level selection screens. I eventually created methods that I felt were satisfactory in this situation although for a more reusable implementation I would have prefered to create a new class specifically for writing text to the screen.
